# A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size.
# So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area,
# your job by now is to design a rectangular web page,
# whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
#
# The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
# The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
# The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
#
# Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of
# the web page you designed in sequence.

area = 4
print(obj.constructRectangle(area))     # Output: [2,2]
# Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways
# to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
# But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal;
# according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
# So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
